Hey Eddie, the other Bird,

Its me, your wife...Claudia Bird *insert sunglasses emoji here*, and I just wanted to let you know something important. I love you to (the radience of convergence of the number series for e^x) and back. I would also like to add that I think that you are an incredible person: kind hearted, determined, consistent, incredibly intelligent, and you dad jokes are unmatched. I hope that you aren't feeling too down right now, because I don't like when you are sad and not like yourself. Anyway, I hope you have enjoyed this monologue on your official document.

I love you,
Claudia (the possibly cooler) Bird
