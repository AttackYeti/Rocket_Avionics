To-Do List
-----------
Hardware
	-Build proto for V0.2
		-Replace Power supply
		-Replace Ignition Circuit
		-Replace SD Card Module
		-Replace Relays
	-Construct new avionics mount
	-Construct testing avionics mount
	-Build Lil' Lad
	-Build more deployment charges
	-Improve charge isolation
	-Find something besides friction fit to keep nose cone attached

Software
	-Implement RTC
	-Implement GPS
	-Update BARO
	-Update IMU
	-Acceleration based algorithm for deployment
	-Calibrate Accelerometer/Gyro/Magnetometer
	-Calibrate Baro (Need script to update calibration on launch day)
	-Set RTC
	-Improve inline documentation
	-Formal Code Write-up
	-Post Launch Data Analysis Script/Program
	-Python Script to automate launch-day calibrations
	-Look into different datalogging solutions (Current method is absurdly slow)
	-Look into potential communications options
	

Data
	~Acceleration during launch/burnout/apogee/freefall
	~System Current Draw

Ideas
	*Implement Tilt-based backup deployment ???
	*Add GSM 	???
	*Pido Tube	???
