# Rocket_Avionics
This is the central hub for resources relating to the avionics for Space Enterprise Berkeley's Base11 Rocket.

Currently the project uses an Arduino Uno along with relevant sensors. The source code (still under development) has been written using the Arduino IDE and can be found in the .ino file. If you're curious about some of the parts, there is a short (outdated) parts list in notes.txt and there are links to some relevant resources for the components included as well.

readme.txt is the most up to date log of development along with the comments throughout the code. In the future, a formal development log and system report will be made available but it has not been finished yet.
