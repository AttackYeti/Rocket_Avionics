# Rocket_Avionics
This is the central hub for resources relating to the avionics for Space Enterprise Berkeley's Rocket.

Currently the project uses an Arduino Uno along with relevant sensors.

If you're reading this, everything has been deleted because it's worthless garbage. It would have been nice if someone had been concerned enough to even try to look at my code earlier. I might update it eventually.
