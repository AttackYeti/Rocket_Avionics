# Rocket_Avionics
This is the central hub for resources relating to the avionics for Space Enterprise Berkeley's Rocket.
Currently the project uses a microcontroller along with relevant sensors. Below is a description of the contents of this repo, and below that is a brief list of major hardware componnents.

In LAD2-Launc you can find data logged during the system's first launch. It was an unsuccessful launch due to an electrical problem that resulted in complete power loss.

In Notes.txt you can find an up-to-date list of tasks which need to be accomplished for a complete revision of the avionics system.

In controller.ino you can find the code in development for the system.

Components
-------
IMU - BNO055  
BARO- BMP388  
RTC - DS3231  
MCU - Espressif ESP32
