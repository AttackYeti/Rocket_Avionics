# Rocket_Avionics
This is the central hub for resources relating to the avionics for Space Enterprise Berkeley's Base11 Rocket.

Currently the project uses an Arduino Uno along with relevant sensors. The source code (still under development) can be found in the .ino file. A schematic can be found in the .pdf file. And if you want to look at the schematic in a fairly simple hobby electronics program called Fritzing (it won't offer much more info than the pdf) then that is also available. If you're curious about some of the parts, there is a short parts list in notes.txt and there are links to some relevant resources for the components included as well.
